I have developed this plugin while developing the mixed reality fitness game [HitMotion:Reloaded](https://hitmotion.games/) at my agency New Technology Walkers.

I'm releasing this for free, to be helpful for the community. I would really appreciate whatever kind of support if you use this plugin in your project: a hug, a thank you, a subscription to the newsletter of [my blog](https://skarredghost.com), a mention in the credits of your project, a collaboration proposal for your XR project, a donation of 1 million Euros on my [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/skarredghost), the phone number of Scarlett Johansson, etc... 

You can contact me [here](https://skarredghost.com/contact/) if you wish.
